# Meteor Reviews ðŸŒ 

Meteor Reviews is a **movie catalog application developed in the MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) that **allows users to leave and edit reviews** depending on the logged-in user.

User login is managed on the frontend and passed as props, while reviews are stored in a MongoDB database. The catalog allows **filtering by title or rating**, as well as **functional pagination** using a cursor on the backend.

- The backend is an API for managing a [mockup movie database](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/sample-mflix/), structured in its respective DAOs for reviews and movies, controllers, and a routing file to handle GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
- The frontend is developed in React + Vanilla JavaScript using the [Vite environment](https://vitejs.dev/). The design is 100% responsive and original, created with [Sass CSS](https://sass-lang.com/).
